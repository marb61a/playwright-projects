Installation
    - Setup npm and prettier (if user wants to use prettier)
    - Install playwright test not playwright which is a general web automation tool
        - npm install @playwright/test
    - Then install the full framework
        - npx playwright install

Fundamentals
    - Create a tests folder in the project
    - Tests will be written in Typescript which is standard practice
    - To run playwright, at the command line enter -> npx playwright test
        - Default is to run test in headless mode
    - To run Playwright in headed mode use the following command (See the browser open)
        - npx playwright test --headed
        - Headed tests are slower
    - To run using a specific browser use the following command
        - npx playwright test --browser=firefox
        - This may create issues with the anti-virus !!!
        - This can be combined with headed mode using the following command
            - npx playwright test --headed --browser=firefox
    - To run all browsers when running Playwright
        - npx playwright test --browser=all
        - Again this will be a lot slower for testing
        - Tests are ran in parallel
    - Specific tests can be ran using the following command
        - npx playwright test <path_to_test>
        - npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
        - Incorrect paths will show a no tests found messge
